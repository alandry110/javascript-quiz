# Web APIs Challenge: JavaScript Code Quiz

DISCLAIMER: I was not able to finish this project in the alloted time so it does not function as it should. The only thing I was able to build out was the HTML and CSS

## About the Repository
The purpose of this repository was to create JavaScript Code Quiz that features dynamically updated HTML CSS powered by JavaScript code. When you deploy the application you will see that it has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
For this project, I was given a set of critical requirements to build a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. They are as follows:
